# cantonese-lyrics-helper
I wrote this little script to help me write Cantonese song lyrics.

Functions:
- Character dictionary for searching jyutpin of characters (tradtioncal Chinese characters)
- Chinese words dictionary with way to many words lol (tradtioncal / simplified Chinese characters)
- Homonyms dictionary
- Fetch and save lyrics from Mojim.com (song names in traditional Chinese characters)
- Mark lyrics with jyutpin

Note:
Dictiontary data are found from the web.

TODO:
- maybe remove some useless words from words dictionary, it includes many names of people and such.
